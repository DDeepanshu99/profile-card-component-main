### What I learned

I learned about CSS background properties as I had to implement them in this project. On the surface, it looked like an easy layout to build. However, the challenging parts for me were the background SVGs and the profile picture. This was challenging because I had only worked with normal backgrounds before. Here, I had to position the background SVGs in a specific manner. Additionally, making the profile picture appear half inside and half outside the banner was also tricky to do.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is a really good resource for learning web dev stuff.
